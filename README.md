Welcome to Football Today, this is a mock up of Sports based app for the English Premier League

(Authors note, tried to make a site for the MLS, but truthfully not many people care about that league)

So as you will see this website is create with React. It uses Tailwind CSS for the styling. React-router-dom, and Axios for the back end. It also uses React News ticker, for the little ticker widget on the main page, and it also uses React loading spinner as well. 

TO DO. 

Gonna change the News Section to either pull from a API of latest football clips. Or see if I can find a free api that will allow me to make a Player Stats Page.
